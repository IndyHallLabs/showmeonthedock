INTRODUCTION

Hello and thanks for checking out ShowMeOnTheDock.

This program was conceived as a tool to help icon developers.  Basically, it lets
you see your work in it's native habitat, the Dock.  Drag an icon (.icns) file 
onto ShowMeOnTheDock, and it'll be displayed in place of the app's icon.
